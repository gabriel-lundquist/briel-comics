A white, black and magenta nine-panel comics page. Panel 1: a whale with the text "IN THE WHALE" above it. Panel 2: three figures sit on a wooden raft in a pool of water in the mouth of a whale. Two have black shadows, one has a pink shadow. The man with the black shadow says, "What are you going to do when you get out?" Panel 3: the man says, "I'm going to eat at my favorite adobo place. Shoot the shit with Urduja." He imagines a scene with him sitting at a bar eating adobo, talking to a woman behind the counter. The woman with the pink shadow says, "That's nice..." Panel 4: the woman with the black shadow says, "I'm going to fuck the first person I see." The man laughs, "Hah!" The woman with the pink shadow looks at her wanly. Panel 5: The woman with the black shadow says, "And I'm going to go to every party and get smashed to hell." She imagines herself in a room full of people, drinking from a bottle she holds over her head. The woman with the pink shadow asks, "See, but will you? Did you do that before we got stuck here?" Panel 6: the woman with the black shadow crosses her arms in front of her and says, "Doesn't matter. I'm different now." The woman with the pink shadow holds her knees to her chest and says, "I don't know..." The man with the black shadow says, "I can see it. Just wanting to connect with someone." Panel 7: the woman with the pink shadow holds herself tighter and says, "True. That's all I want. Just to connect with someone again." Panel 8: the woman with the pink shadow is alone on the raft, under the enormous ribs of the whale's mouth. The people with the black shadows are gone. Panel 9: the whale swims into the deep.
