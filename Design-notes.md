# Design

## General philosophy
I want something lightweight and clean, not dependent on a bunch of frameworks. I'm not interested in webdev for its own sake. Rather, I want to make a website that centers the comics and allows for projects like an SQL database for retrieving comic pages and a fuzzy search algorithm. I want to center the comics.

Archive reading should have seamless, intuitive interaction, as well as very few visual cues other than the comic page itself.

## Pages 

### Comics viewing pages
- Simple: few elements 
- Responsive to different viewport sizes
    - High-resolution image taking up middle of the screen with wide margins, for 4k displays
    - Mid-resolution image with same-proportion margins as above for HD displays
    - 1080p image that takes up the whole browser width for 1080p displays (phone displays); also, where appropriate, swapping to image with vertical panel layout
- back and next buttons, skip to last update/next update buttons
- index/archive button
- 

### Archive page
- page-by-page list
- update list
- story list
- search bar (goes to search page)

### Search page
- search by tag
- search by title
- search by character
- fuzzy search by dialogue
- fuzzy search by description (includes dialogue)
- search by date range
- reverse image search (???)
- Listen. This is too much but I think it will be a fun project.

### Landing page
- link to most recent update
- blog posts?
- links to other comics 
- web ring?

### Comments board???
- maybe vulnerable to spam but... imagine......
- I could try out different comics websites' comment section
